# ü§ñVoice Command to switching lamp

This project is part of a larger system that simulates how a chatbot could interact with Internet of Things (IoT) devices, showcasing the integration of speech recognition with Pygame as a visual interface

## ‚úÖÔ∏èFeatures:

- **Voice Command Recognition**: The program listens to your voice commands using the microphone.
- **Pygame Display**: Based on the recognized command, the screen color changes to represent the light turning on or off.

## ‚úÖÔ∏èDependencies:

- **Pygame**: For creating the graphical window and handling events.
- **Speech Recognition**: For converting voice commands into text using Google‚Äôs speech recognition API.

## ‚úÖÔ∏èUsage:

1. Run the script.
2. The program will listen for commands such as "light on" or "light off".
3. Upon recognizing the command, the screen will change its color accordingly.

##Note:
This project is a simple Python application that uses **Pygame** and **Speech Recognition** to control a virtual light on the screen using voice commands. When the user says "light on", the screen color changes to yellow, simulating the light turning on. When the user says "light off", the screen turns navy blue, simulating the light turning off.
